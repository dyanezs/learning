# Learning

Welcome to my educational journey repository. Here, I document and organize the various resources and materials that I've used to learn new skills and knowledge in my field. This repository serves as both a personal tracker of my progress and a curated collection of educational content for anyone interested in following a similar learning path.

## Introduction

This repository is a structured collection of books, courses, videos, and certifications that I have engaged with over the course of my learning. It includes notes, summaries, assignments, and certificates that showcase my educational milestones.

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each folder in this repository represents a different topic or subject area. Within each topic folder, you will find a variety of materials that I have used to deepen my understanding of that subject. Here's a brief explanation of the directory structure:

- **/resources/**: The main directory where all learning materials are stored, organized by topics.

## Learning Materials

The learning materials can be:

- **Books**: One of my preferred resources for learning. I'll provide chapter summaries for every book I read, along with screenshots or other sources/links for additional information.
- **Online-Courses**: Mainly from platforms like Udemy, Udacity, and Coursera.
- **In-Person-Courses**: If I attend any in-person courses, I'll share my notes here.
- **Youtube-Videos/Courses**: While not as structured as formal online courses, they offer valuable insights.
- **Certifications**: I'll list my professional certifications here. Distinct from course completion certificates, these indicate specialized skills and knowledge.

For more detailed information on what each topic directory contains, please refer to the individual `README.md` files within each directory.
